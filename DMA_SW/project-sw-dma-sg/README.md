DMA Transfer using sctter-list. It caculate the page numbers of the buffer. It transmit and receive data page by page. User do not need to call dma transfer mutiple times when transfer large amount of data. However, the scatter-list receive can only receive 2048 bytes data. The reason might due to the receive buffer do not get the data and cause dma timeout. We thought that using receive scatter-list does not make sense and using receive single here might slove the problem.
